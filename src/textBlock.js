                Welcome to my portofolio<br/><br/>
                My hobby is to design the graphical user interface of a website, besides that I also like to exercise like swimming and playing badminton. When I'm bored I also really like playing video games and listening to music.

                But when something strange draws you out of your lookout tower and into the world below, you'll explore a wild and unknown environment, facing questions and making interpersonal choices that can build or destroy the only meaningful relationship you have. */}
